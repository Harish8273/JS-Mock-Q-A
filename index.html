        1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.

var x = 10;
var y = "10";

console.log(x===y);

- Both are comparison operators and they return boolean values always. The difference
between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas “ === “ is
used to compare both value and datatype.

- output will be false because both value and datatype are not same.

    </pre>

        2. What is a spread operator?

- The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array
 or object.

- The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.

const array1 = [1,2,3];
const array2 = [4,5,6];
const combinedarray = [...array1, ...array2];

console.log(combinedarray)
    </pre>

        3. What are the differences between var, let and const?

- Variables declared with "var" in Javascript are function scoped. It can be redeclared and reinitialized.

- Variables declared with "let & const" in Javascript are blocked scoped. "let" cannot be redeclared but it can be reinitialized.
But "const" cannot be redeclared and cannot be reinitialized.

        4. What is execution context?

- Each and every browser is having a JavaScript Engine, example Google is having V8 engine,
Internet Explorer is having Chakra and Mozilla Firefox is having Spider Monkey.

</center><b>Execution Context-</b> The environment in which our code is executed and is evaluated. ===> Global execution context default

- Javascript engine creates the global execution context before it starts to execute any code. 
- Variables, and functions that is not inside any function. A new execution context gets created every time a function is executed.
-During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables
and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets
executed.
- There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
● Global Execution Context (GEC)
● Function Execution Context (FEC)

- The moment code gets executed GEC gets created and gets pushed to Call Stack. Inside the
global or functional execution context, there are two phases : Memory allocation (Creation
Phase) and Code execution (Execution Phase).
Inside Memory allocation, the variables declared using var keyword get memory allocated as
undefined in global scope and variables declared using let or const gets their memory allocated
as undefined in block scope.

-That is the reason why we can access the variables before initialization declared using var, it
will give undefined.

-But if we will try to access the variables using let const before their initialization then it will
give Reference Error because these variables will be in block scope and can not be accessed
until unless they are not initialized. This is also known as temporal dead zone.
Whereas, functions gets memory allocated as their actual value defined in code. Inside Code
Execution, variables will get their actual value assigned to them. And functions will create a
functional execution context.

-The moment this FEC will be created, it will be pushed to Call stack and once the execution of
the function is over then this FEC will be removed from the call stack and the point of
execution will again be moved to GEC.

        5. What is meant by first class functions ?

        - In javascript we can assign a function to a variable . Also, as a methods.

        // assigning a function to the variable example

let harry = function(){
    console.log("My nickname is Harry")
}
harry();


        - Assigning a method in javascript is super easy as well. Similar to how we can assign a function to a variable
         we can assign a function as a value to a key in an object. 

         // assigning a function to the object example

let aboutme = {
    fname : "Harry",
    lname : "kumar",
    qualification : function(){
        console.log("I did B.tech in Mechanical Engineering");
    },
    sex : "Male",
}
aboutme.qualification()

        - Pass a function as a argument.

        // Pass a function as a argument.

const myName = () =>{
    return "Harry";
}
const greeting = (sayHi, name) => {
    console.log(sayHi() + " " + name);
}
greeting(myName, "Harish Kumar");

        - Since function are first class citizens in javascript, we are able to pass them.   
        - Returning functions- This is a key concept when it comes to functional programming.

        // returning function or callback function..

function a(){
    return function b(){
        console.log("I will be expert in Javascript one day.")
    }
}
// a()();

const c = a();

c();

        So we can say that "function is first class citizen in javascript".

       6.  What are closures? Give an example of closures?

       - A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

       - Closure in action that is inner function can have access to the outer function variables/parameters as well as
        all the global variables.

       - The return statement doses not execute the inner function- function is executed only when followed by (),
        but rather the return statement returns the entire body of the function.

        const outerFun = (a) => {
            let b = 10;
            const innerFun = () => {
                let sum = a + b;
                console.log(`The sum of two number a & b is ${sum}`);
            }
            innerFun();
        }
        outerFun(5);

        output- The sum of two number a & b is 15
    </pre>

        7. Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind() ?

        These all three methods are used to invoke a function where we are supposed to pass an object
as first argument and at the time of definition we don't have mention this object as a parameter
and we can access the values of object by using this keyword in function definition.

- Call is a function that helps you change the context of the invoking function. In layperson's terms,
 it helps you replace the value of this inside a function with whatever value you want.

 - Apply is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.

- Bind is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the
 new context of this that is provided.  

 let userDetails = {
    name: "Harish",
    age: 24,
    designation: "Web developer",
}
let printDetails= function(state, country){
    console.log(this.name+ " " +"from"+ " " +state+ " "+country)
}
printDetails.call(userDetails, "UttarPradesh", "India");

let userDetails2 = {
    name: "Ashish",
    age: 22,
    designation: "student"
    }
    // function borrowing
printDetails.call(userDetails2, "Delhi", "India")

// Apply

printDetails.apply(userDetails2, ["Delhi", "India"]);

// Bind

let newfun = printDetails.bind(userDetails, "Delhi", "India")
newfun;
